## Planning and Testing Process
- After we had a discussion , we chose black box techniques (error guessing and exploratory) as our testing method to get an idea on the application before writing our test cases, since we didn't have any access to the code.
- Using the BDD (Behavioural Driven Design) , we moved onto writing the feature files and scenarios.
- Then started deviding features between the team members.
- Each team member started working on his individual feature.
- We shared and helped each other.
- We concluded with writing the test summary report.

## Problem-Solving Strategy

- lots and lots of **googling** and reading official **documentation**.
- Using the refrences supplied to us by our instructor.
